# Password-Generator
Project Name: Password Generator


Contributors: Nathaniel (Nat) Epstein

Technologies Used: JavaScript

Description: The goal of this assignment was to use JavaScript to make a random password generator. 

Setup/Installation Requirements:
Clone the repository.

Known Bugs:
Will continue to execute code despite the conditional statement for password length even if the requirements are met. HTML and CSS elements will not appear until all confirmations and alerts appear. Can't figure out how to have the click generate password button to have all the alerts show up.
